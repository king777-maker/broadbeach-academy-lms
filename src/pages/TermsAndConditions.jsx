            <p>
              Certificates awarded by Broadbeach Academy attest to course completion
              and verified knowledge acquisition through our assessment framework.
              While our curriculum aligns with international standards (such as ISO 19011
              and ISO/IEC 17024 competency guidelines), a certificate of achievement
              issued by Broadbeach Academy does <strong>not</strong> by itself constitute:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-2">
              <li>A statutory government license or formal license to practice.</li>
              <li>Formal lead auditor registration with external bodies (such as IRCA/CQI) unless explicitly certified through a designated accredited partnership scheme.</li>
              <li>An authorization or accreditation to certify other commercial enterprises or issue third-party ISO conformity certificates.</li>

            <p>
              <strong>3.1 Assessment Requirements:</strong> Certificates are issued
              only upon meeting the passing score (typically 70% or higher) in the
              corresponding final assessment. Enrollment alone does not guarantee a certificate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3.2 Anti-Fraud & Authenticity:</strong> Each digital certificate
              carries a unique verification identifier accessible via our verification portal (<code className="bg-slate-100 px-1 rounded">/verify-certificate</code>). Altering, forging, modifying, or misrepresenting certificate credentials is a criminal offense and grounds for immediate credential revocation and legal action.
